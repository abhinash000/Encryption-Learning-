# XOR Encryption for Password Storage

This C program demonstrates how to securely store and retrieve passwords using the XOR encryption algorithm. The program allows you to save a password in an encrypted format and later retrieve it by decrypting it using the same key.

**Note**: XOR encryption is a basic form of encryption and is not suitable for secure password storage in real-world applications. This implementation is for educational purposes only.

## Overview

This program implements XOR encryption to encrypt and store a user password in a file, and then decrypt it when needed. It uses a constant key, `'X'`, to XOR each character in the password for both encryption and decryption.

## How It Works

The password is encrypted by XORing each character with a key, and the encrypted password is stored in a file. When the password is retrieved, the same XOR operation is applied to decrypt it.

### Key Points:
- XOR encryption is symmetric: the same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
- The program supports two main operations:
  - **Save Password**: Encrypts and saves the password to a file.
  - **Retrieve Password**: Decrypts the password from the file and displays it.

## Compilation

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt.
3. Navigate to the project folder where the C file is located.
4. Compile the program using `gcc` (GNU Compiler Collection) or another C compiler.

```bash
gcc xor_encryption.c -o xor_encryption
```

This will generate an executable named `xor_encryption` (or `xor_encryption.exe` on Windows).

## Usage

### Save Password

1. Run the compiled program:

```bash
./xor_encryption
```

2. Choose option `1` to save a password.
3. Enter your password when prompted.
4. The password will be encrypted and saved in a file called `passwords.enc`.

### Retrieve Password

1. Run the program again.
2. Choose option `2` to retrieve the saved password.
3. The program will decrypt the password and display it.

## Example

Hereâ€™s how the program might look in action:

```bash
1. Save Password
2. Retrieve Password
Choose an option: 1
Enter your password: MySecretPassword
Password saved securely!

1. Save Password
2. Retrieve Password
Choose an option: 2
Decrypted Password: MySecretPassword
```

## Code Explanation

### Key Functions:

1. **encrypt_decrypt**: 
   - Takes an input string and XORs each character with the key (`'X'`).
   - The output string is returned as the encrypted or decrypted result.

2. **save_password**:
   - Prompts the user for a password, encrypts it using `encrypt_decrypt()`, and saves the result to a file (`passwords.enc`).

3. **read_password**:
   - Reads the encrypted password from the file (`passwords.enc`), decrypts it using `encrypt_decrypt()`, and prints the result.

4. **main**:
   - Provides the user with an option to either save or retrieve the password.

```c
void encrypt_decrypt(char *input, char *output) {
    int len = strlen(input);
    for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        output[i] = input[i] ^ KEY; // XOR encryption
    }
    output[len] = '\0'; // Null-terminate the string
}
```

In the above function, `KEY` is the constant XOR key used for encryption and decryption.
